[comment]: [Curriculum Vitae (CV)](https://amaya-murguia.github.io/files/Amaya_CV.pdf)

I am a fifth year electrical engineering Ph.D. student at the University of Michigan working with Dr. Jeffrey A. Fessler and Dr. Jon-Fredrik Nielsen in the Functional MRI Lab on quantitative MRI analysis of the brain.  I specifically focus on studying myelin and white matter lesions of tissue samples from patients with Alzheimerâ€™s Disease.  My research interests include both experimental and computational aspects of MRI imaging, including scanning, data acquisition, sequence development, image processing, image reconstruction, and quantitative parameter mapping.
